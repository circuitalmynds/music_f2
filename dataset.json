        "description": "\"Mademoiselle\" was recorded by The Ray Noble Orchestra was Recorded in London on September 13, 1933 and the vocals were by Al Bowlly.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBowlly was born in Lourenço Marques in the Portuguese colony of Mozambique. His parents were Greek and Lebanese. They met en route to Australia and moved to South Africa.\n\nBowlly was brought up in Johannesburg.After a series of odd jobs across South Africa, including barber and jockey, he sang in a dance band led by Edgar Adeler on a tour of South Africa, Rhodesia, India, and Indonesia during the mid-1920s. He was fired from the band in Surabaya, Indonesia.\n\nJimmy Liquime hired him to sing with the band in India and Singapore In 1927 Bowlly made his first record, a cover version of \"Blue Skies\" by Irving Berlin that was recorded with Adeler in Berlin, Germany. During the next year, he worked in London, England, with the orchestra of Fred Elizalde.\n\nThe onset of the Great Depression in 1929 resulted in Bowlly being made redundant and returning to several months of busking to survive. In the 1930s, he signed two contracts—one in May 1931 with Roy Fox, singing in his live band for the Monseigneur Restaurant in London, the other a record contract with bandleader Ray Noble in November 1930.\n\nDuring the next four years, he recorded over 500 songs. By 1933 Lew Stone had ousted Fox as bandleader, and Bowlly was singing Stone's arrangements with Stone's band. After much radio exposure and a successful British tour with Stone, Bowlly was inundated with demands for appearances and gigs—including undertaking a solo British tour—but continued to make most of his recordings with Noble. There was considerable competition between Noble and Stone for Bowlly's time. For much of the year, Bowlly spent all day in the recording studio with Noble's band, rehearsing and recording, then the evening with Stone's band at the Monseigneur. Many of these recordings with Noble were issued in the United States by Victor, which meant that by the time Noble and Bowlly came to America, their reputation had preceded them.\n\nHe performed in England with his band, the Radio City Rhythm Makers But by 1937 the band broke up when vocal problems were traced to a wart in his throat, briefly causing him to lose his voice. Separated from his wife, and with his band dissolved, he borrowed money from friends and traveled to New York City for surgery.\n\nHis absence from the UK in the early 1930s damaged his popularity with British audiences, despite his association with pianist Monia Liter as his accompanist. His career began to suffer as a result of problems with his voice, which affected the frequency of his recordings. He played a few small parts in films, but the parts were often cut and scenes that were shown were brief. Noble was offered a role in Hollywood, although the offer excluded Bowlly because a singer had already been hired. Bowlly moved back to London with his wife Marjie in January 1937.\n\nWith diminished success in Britain, he toured regional theatres and recorded as often as possible to make a living, moving from orchestra to orchestra, working with Sydney Lipton, Gerald Bright and Ken \"Snakehips\" Johnson. In 1940 there was a revival of interest in his career when he worked in a duo with Jimmy Messene in Radio Stars with Two Guitars on the London stage. It was his last venture before his death in April 1941. The partnership was uneasy. Messene had a drinking problem. When he showed up for work, he was occasionally unable to perform. Bowlly recorded his last song two weeks before his death. It was a duet with Messene of Irving Berlin's satirical song about Hitler, \"When That Man is Dead and Gone\".\n\nI have used footage of the Ray Noble Orchestra from when they were touring Holland in 1934,  from what I am aware this is the only footage of them publicly available.  Footage of Al Bowlly was taken from Pathe News and later footage of Ray Noble was taken from an American TV series from 1948 called \"Merry Go Round\".  full videos can be seen on the BRITISH PATHE channel (Thank you British Pathe)\n\nPlease LIKE AND SUBSCRIBE TO THIS CHANNEL if you like my videos.he Old Spinning Wheel was recorded by The Ray Noble Orchestra in 1933 and the vocals were by Al Bowlly.\n\nTHE ORIGINAL VIDEO FOOTAGE CAN BE FOUND IN THE FOLLOWING LINKS :",

Adolfi and distributed by Warner Bros. The all talking Vitaphone production cost $850,000 and was shot almost entirely in Technicolor. \nThe Show of Shows was Warner Bros.' fifth color film. \nThe film was styled in the same format as the earlier Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Hollywood Revue of 1929. The high budget of the film meant that although it performed well at the box office, it did not return as much profit as The Hollywood Revue of 1929.  \n\"Just an Hour of Love\" – Performed by Irene Bordoni in the movie.  \nThe film features nearly all the stars then working under contract at Warner Bros. Virtually all the performers shown would vanish from the studio by 1931, after tastes had shifted owing to the effects of the Great Depression, which began to be felt late in 1930. \nThe Show of Shows features many of the performers who were popular in silent movies mixed in with hand-picked stage stars and novelty acts. The emcee of the film was Frank Fay, who performed in the style of barbed sarcasm. In an era of almost naive optimism, he stands out as a witty devil's advocate. \nThe Show of Shows featured most of the contemporary Warner Bros. film stars, including John Barrymore, Richard Barthelmess, Noah Beery Sr., Loretta Young, Dolores Costello, Bull Montana, Myrna Loy, Chester Conklin, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Tully Marshall, Nick Lucas, and Betty Compson.\n\nIrène Bordoni (16 January 1885 – 19 March 1953) was a Corsican-American actress and singer. \nNoted for her seductive brown eyes and coquettish personality, Irène Bordoni is probably best remembered from musical theatre as the star of the 1928 Cole Porter musical Paris. \nThroughout her Broadway career, Bordoni was renowned for wearing only the most stylish of clothes, including costumes by Erté. \nShe died on 19 March 1953 at Jewish Memorial Hospital in Manhattan. She was interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.",

Su progresión de acordes, conocida como \"rhythm changes\", es la base para otras muchas composiciones de jazz, como el tema de Charlie Parker y Dizzy Gillespie, \"Anthropology (Thrivin' From a Riff)\".\n\nLa canción se compuso para el musical Girl Crazy, que también incluía otros temas que se convirtieron en estándares, como \"Embraceable You\" o \"But Not For Me\", y ha sido interpretada por un gran número de artistas de jazz. Fue escrita originalmente como una canción en tempo lento para Treasure Girl (1928) y más tarde incorporada a Girl Crazy. Ethel Merman cantó la canción en la producción original de Broadway. La canción se convirtió en parte importante de la banda sonora de la película musical de 1951, Un americano en París, interpretada por Gene Kelly, que la bailaba además en claqué.\n\nLa canción fue más tarde revisada y ampliada por el propio Gershwin, incluyéndola dentro de su composición de música clásica, Variations on \"I Got Rhythm\", de 1934.",

Vivace ma non troppo – 21:19\nIgnacy Feliks Dobrzyński (15 February 1807 – 9 October 1867) was a Polish pianist and composer.\n“Exceptionally talented musically and extremely well-educated, initially by his father [a conductor, composer and teacher] and later by Jozef Elsner, Dobrzynski embarked early on a pianistic career as a 'child prodigy' showing off his talent by performing virtuoso pieces. In 1825 he turned up in Warsaw to take private lessons with Elsner, to whom he recommended his compositional talents on grounds of earlier written works at the tender age of seventeen [1824]. The works in question were his Concert Overture in D major, Op. 1 and Piano Concerto in A flat major, Op. 2. \nSuch serious compositions undoubtedly made an impression on the strict and demanding Professor Elsner. A year later Dobrzynski officially became Elsner's pupil at Warsaw's Principal School of Music, that same year [1826] being joined by Fryderyk Chopin as a classmate. \nPiano Concerto in A flat major, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra was composed the same year [1824] as Beethoven was completing his Symphony No. 6 in D minor. Despite the coincidental dates, it already belongs to a different era and although structured in keeping with the best Classical concerto designs, its character and exploitation of piano textures and orchestral tone-colours opens up new perspectives.\nThe piano which dominates is obliged to 'sing' in lyrical sections and 'shine' in virtuoso passages, scales and figurations. The orchestra is there to provide background for the soloist, only occasionally entering into dialogue with the piano or taking the lead. The work opens with an Allegro moderato movement in sonata form consisting of two subjects, development and coda. The fact that five years later Chopin would compose his Piano Concerto in F minor in a similar architectonic scheme to Dobrzynski's, gives food for thought and begs the question, was Chopin familiar with his colleague's work? There are many signs to suggest he was; therefore one can assume that even Chopin—most probably—exploited Dobrzynski's concept in a section of the second movement of his Concerto in F minor where against the background of orchestral tremolo the piano plays simultaneously in both hands recitative progressions of a dramatic character. Given the similarities between the works of the two composers we can make certain assumptions, such as for example, that Professor Elsner actually encouraged Chopin to model his concerto on Dobrzynski's composition...\nThe score of Dobrzyriski's Concerto in A flat major has survived almost in its entirety to this day [Warsaw Music Society Archives], barring one vandalised page containing the third movement's final tutti. In 1986 the manuscript of the work was reviewed by the composer and conductor Kazimierz Rozbicki from Koszalin who reconstructed the missing text, corrected the musical orthography and reworked the entire piece [i.a. changed the tuning of horns and trumpets to the modern pitch of today's instruments]. According to Andrzej Spoz, a researcher of Dobrzynski's compositions, the work was not performed public during the composer's lifetime. It received its premiere on 10 September 1986 at the Polish Piano Festival in Slupsk and was first recorded to CD by Jerzy Sterczynski in 1994.” (from Album notes by Stanislaw Dybowski)",
